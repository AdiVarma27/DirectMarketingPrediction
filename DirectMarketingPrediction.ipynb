    "In this notebook, we are going to explore the direct marketing dataset. First, we start off with Exploratory Data Analysis, followed by feature engineering steps, walk through imputation, apply Machine Learning models, and interpret the results. We look at individual model performance, hypoerparameter tuning and look at different evaluation metrics. Later, we understand cost-benefit analysis for our problem and finally deploy a few models via. Airflow.\n",

    "* From the above paper, we see that the source contains features of customers, who are **targeted through Telemarketing calls, to sell long-term deposits**. The dataset also includes calls where the client calls customer care for some reason, and long-term deposits are upsold at end of conversation as well. Hence, the dataset also contains a **label**, which denotes success or no-success on selling long-term deposits.\n",

    "* The dataset comes from a rea Portuguese retail bank, from May 2008 to June 2013, with 52,944 phone calls in total. As expected with real world datasets, the dataset is imbalanced (different number of successful and unsuccessful outcome of treatment effect). The author also includes other interesting external resources such as socio-economic factors (Unemployment variation) and so on. We could also look at other socia-economic metrics about Portugal for those years and see if they might influence any purchasing decision making process.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Given we have previous campaign information (campaign, contact and outcome), we could potentially find clusters of customers (Clustered by Treatment-Response). Hence, with respect to modeling, we have clear **Supervised Learning** & **Unsupervised Learning** tasks at hand. Other than that, we have a ton of interesting questions to answer with the dataset through **Exploratory Analysis & Visualizations**. Lets start by importing the required libraries & dataset."
